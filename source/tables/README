                              TABLES
                              ======
The files in source/tables define the pervasive tables and instruction 
format tables.

pervasives:

 pervasives.h{c}
 ===============
  Defines the pervasive tables for pervasive kinds, type skeletons
  and constants. Note these files are automatically generated.

 pervinit.h{c}
 =============
  Defines the initialization functions for pervasive tables: such functions
  are necessary because the pervasive names in the system run-time have 
  special encoding in the simulator (source/simulator/mcstring.h{c}) for
  garbage collection as opposed to simply C strings. These names have to
  be laid out on the system memory upon system initialization.

 instructions.h{c}
 =================
  Defines instruction formats and instruction opcodes.
  Note these files are automatically generated.
