=========
  The test cases
   ./assoc
   ./assoclists
   ./copy
   ./lists
   ./lists2
   ./funs
   ./maps 
   ./reverse
  have passed the compiler testing.

  The linked files of these test cases are not correct yet because of a problem
  with regard to the next clause tables. Note the expected files in those
  directories are not entirely correct.

  The linker fails on ./assoc and ./funs because of the missing treatment
  of instruction operand type INSTR_SEG in the linker.
