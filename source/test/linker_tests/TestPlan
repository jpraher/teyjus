Linker tests
============

1. Constant renaming (accumulte and import)
   a. renaming to parent modules' global constant/kind
   b. renaming to parent modules' local constant/kind

   test cases: renaming_acc, renaming_imp

  

2. Combine definitions of predicates in accumulating and accumulated modules:

3. Resolve call and execute across modules:
