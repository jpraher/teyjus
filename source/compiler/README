Building Teyjus tjc:
	1. Build ocamake:
		In the util directory, build ocamake.ml:
		
		ocamlc unix.cma str.cma ocamake.ml -o ocamake.exe

		And then install it in your PATH.
	2. Compile:
		ocamake *.ml *.mli *.mly *.mll -opt -o tjc
		
		or, using the supplied makefile:
	
		make

Running tjc:
	tjc currently supports 3 arguments:
		--preabsyn:	Prints the preabsyn to a file.
		--absyn:	Prints the absyn to a file.
		--input:	Specifies the input file.

	A fourth option is in the works, but isn't done:
		--tables:	Prints the symbol tables that the
				module is being compiled against.
Notes:
	There will be numerous warnings.  These are being fixed
	right now.  All of them refer to nonexhaustive match
	warnings, or with disregarding the result of a function.

	There are a lot of places where the error messages aren't
	as good as they could be. Those are on the to-do list.
