New loader expectations on the output of the compiler.

The loader expects that if a predicate definition is given such that no choice point instructions are used at the top level, that space for a try_me_else instruction is left before the beginning of that code.

Similarly, if the instruction pointed to by the variable term of a switch_on_term instruction is not a try_me_else instruction, that there is space for such an instruction preceding that one.

Also, uses of the call instruction in the bytecode file will refer to the index of called predicate in the constant table.
