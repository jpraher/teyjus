This package handles the following features:
  - Syntax highlighting for .mod and .sig files
  - Running an inferior tjcc process within Emacs
  - Teyjus support for emacs compilation mode (M-x compile)

Commands have been added to make easier the use of Teyjus:

 Command                Shortcut     Function
 ----------             --------     --------
 M-x teyjus-compile     C-c C-c      Compile a module
 M-x teyjus-next-error  C-c C-n      Find the next compilation error
 M-x teyjus-prev-error  C-c C-p      Find the previous compilation error

These commands are also available via the Teyjus menu


To use the Teyjus Emacs interface, add this line to your .emacs file:

  (load "~/teyjus/emacs/teyjus.el")

Adjust the path as neccesary. If tjcc is not in your $PATH then you
should set the variable tjcc to the precise location. For example,

  (setq tjcc "~/teyjus/tjcc")
