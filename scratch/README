SCRATCH DIRECTORY:
  This directory is home to tests and examples that shouldn't be in the final
  repository; used to share information between developers.

CONTENTS:

abbrevtest:
  Some simple type abbreviation tests, with errors in constants with types
  constructed from abbreviations.

abbrevtest2:
  Some more abbreviation tests, this time with errors in the application of
  abbreviations.

sigtest:
  Tests that show error messages for errors encountered while processing
  signature constructs (kind/constant declarations, etc).

modtest:
  Tests that show error messages for errors encountered while processing
  module constructs (term/clause parsing).  This is just blist.mod with holes
  poked in it.

separatecomp:
  Currently correct example of using accum_sig and accumulate to build
  up the environment; all of the errors are term parsing ones encountered in
  separatecomp.mod; if you uncomment some of the various errors in
  separatecomp.sig, accumsig1.sig, and accumsig2.sig, you will see examples of
  how such errors are reported.

builtintest:
  Before builtin predicates (pervasives) could be extended, which would crash
  the compiler (and would have messed with the simulator in any event due to the
  way builtins are implemented).  Now all builtins are flagged "nodefs".  This
  module tests this property.
